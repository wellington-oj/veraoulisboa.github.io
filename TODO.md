## Bug Triage

- Runtime has bugs.
- ~~Exercise 8: The non-completion message expects the value 10, but should accept 6 or more.~~ ✔️ Done (`numeros-com-if`).
- ~~Exercise 17: The code example has a validation error.~~ ✔️ Done — the `aleatorio` (dice) feedback check tested `s.rolls`, which the runtime never sets; now reads `s.die` / `s.dice`.
- ~~Exercise 22: In the hint, explain that a string is a list of characters and suggest using `.length` to validate the word length.~~ ✔️ Done — added a new `palavra-passe` exercise (strings as character lists + `.length` validation).
- Found during review: `cesar-desencriptar` explanation said "SPHY"; should be "SPbY". ✔️ Done.
- Found during testing: `donatello-circulo` reference solution (1px/1°×360) never passed its own validate (which required value 10); realigned instructions + validate to the 1px/1° approach. ✔️ Done.
- Objetivos layer its sitting next to the 

## Feature Triage

- Add explanatory animations instead of running text, for greater student engagement. (large — still open)
- Create an interactive tutorial for the student. (large — still open)
- Add visual editing elements (e.g., letter color in the 1st chapter, font size in the 2nd, letter color in the 3rd, etc.). (still open)
- ~~Exercises 19, 20 and 21: Make execution faster.~~ ✔️ Done — lower frame floor + inter-move delay on the donatello loop exercises.
- ~~Exercise 13 onwards: There is no need to add `const podeAvancar: boolean = true;` as it is already predefined in the code.~~ ✔️ Done (`booleanos` instruction reworded).
- New: optional "Avançado" collapsible section per exercise for deeper detail. ✔️ Done (now on all 35 exercises).

### Bug Triage

_All nine resolved 2026-06-23 (✔️ in Task Status (QA) below)._

- 🔴 `intro`: passes automatically (starter already has 8+ char message) — add interactivity check to `validate`
- 🔴 `strings`: explanation promises TS will catch type errors but transpiler strips types silently — update text or add type-checking
- 🔴 `semaforo-amarelo`: can pass without using the `estado` variable — add `/estado/.test(code)` to validate
- 🟡 `numeros-variavel`: hardcoding `84` bypasses the multiplication — verify `/12\s*\*\s*7/.test(code)` in validate
- 🟡 `cesar`: hardcoding `"SPbY"` skips the algorithm — add `/charCodeAt/.test(code)` to validate
- 🟡 `arvore-procura`: `treeSteps <= listSteps` is a false-negative for degenerate (sorted) lists — remove or relax this condition
- 🟡 `donatello-roomba`: valid code may rarely fail if random walk misses a wall in 1200 steps — increase step count or lower wall-reach threshold
- 🟢 `pi` (dardos): 5000 iterations can freeze slow machines — cap total or batch async
- 🟢 `grafo-caminho`: instructions don't mention that path order matters — add a note
